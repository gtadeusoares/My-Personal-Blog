      <h2>Olavo de Carvalho Online Philosophy Course, Lesson 001</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Obituary exercise (memento mori). Why should we do it?</h3> <br>
        To find out what your ideal is and who you want to be <br>
        This ideal will guide you, judge your actions, and correct you <br>
        This ideal is who converses with God <br>
        Without this vision you will permit yourself to be judged by others <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Philosophy</h3> <br>
        The philosophical technique is the technique of converting general concepts into effective experience and vice versa. This is a definition given by Olavo.
        The teacher says that the knowledge that gives philosophy its basis is that knowledge that comes from a most sincere articulation of reality.
        The starting point of philosophical work is psychological and pedagogical. I have to be honest with myself, be able to describe reality and my experiences, and understand the context in which I live to be able to philosophize.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Class structure</h3> <br>
        Exercise of the obituary, knowing the current situation, self-knowledge through dialogue with God, Real and transformative knowledge, correct and sincere expression, literature and language
        <br><br>
        <h3>Obituary exercise</h3> <br>
        This is for me to discover who I want to be, so I can judge my actions, make decisions, etc. It's a first step towards self-knowledge, towards acquiring my personality, my voice. My ideal being is the one who will dialogue with God.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Know the current situation</h3> <br>
        The teacher says that it is important for the philosopher to understand and analyze his social and political context. I must know my social and political position and that of others as well.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Self-knowledge through dialogue with God</h3> <br>
        The teacher here refers to God as the omniscient observer. The omniscient observer knows everything about my life, my actions and thoughts, so there is no point in lying or embellishing my conversation with God. As I openly reveal my life and thoughts to God, He will reveal my life to me.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Real and transformative knowledge</h3> <br>
        We have to seek a real knowledge of the things we can believe and base our decisions on. We have to seek to know reality as it is. Our knowledge, especially of ourselves, must be sincere.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Expression, Literature and Language</h3> <br>
        The expression of experience is the beginning of all human knowledge. We have to become witnesses to reality. Therefore, education must start with literature and language. Literature helps us to express and understand our experiences.
